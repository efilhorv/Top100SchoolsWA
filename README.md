## WA Schools Ranking and Visualization Project
Description
Welcome to the WA Schools Ranking and Visualization Project! This project aims to provide a comprehensive ranking system for schools in Western Australia (WA). 

Leveraging MySQL for robust data storage, Python for data exploration, and QlikView for powerful visualization, the project offers insights into the performance and characteristics of schools across various metrics.

In addition to the school ranking features, this project incorporates geographical data on school locations and cycling pathways in Perth, WA, visualized using GeoJSON.

The combination of data analysis and visualization tools offers a holistic view of the educational landscape and infrastructure in Western Australia.

Data Exploration
Explore and analyze the school data using Python:

Use Python scripts: Execute Python scripts (exploration_script.py) to perform data exploration and analysis.

Statistical analysis: Conduct statistical analysis on key metrics, including ATAR, State Overall Score, Social Economic Status, and more.

Document findings: Document interesting insights and discoveries from the data exploration process.

Visualization in QlikView
Visualize the school data in QlikView to gain valuable insights:

Open QlikView project: Launch the QlikView project file (WA_Schools_Ranking.qvw) to access the visualizations.

Explore dashboards: Navigate through dashboards showcasing the top 10 schools in Government and Non-Government categories.

Visualize rankings: Utilize visualizations based on metrics like ATAR, State Overall Score, Social Economic Status, Suburbs, and more.

Geographical visualizations: Experience geographical representations of school locations and cycling pathways in Perth, WA.

Additional Features
School Maps in Perth: Integration of school maps using GeoJSON for a spatial understanding of school distribution.

Cycling Pathways: Representation of cycling pathways in GeoJSON, providing insights into infrastructure around schools.
